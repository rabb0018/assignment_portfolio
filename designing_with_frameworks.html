        <h2>Designing with Frameworks</h2>
    <p>In this assignment we got introduced to a whole new thing, frameworks! It is time consuming to build a website from scratch each time you have to make one and frameworks makes a webdesigners process easier, when it comes a website fast.
        <br>
        <br>
        We learned how to use two different frameworks, Bootstrap and Pico. I decided to use Pico which has a very minimalistic expression. The website felt like it needed a bit more help to look more polished. So I decided to add some of the font hierarchy knowledge I learned from the Font and UI cards assignment, and also implement some of the gestalt principles about proximity in the CSS file.

        <p>The cool thing about pico is that it don't use classes, only HTML tags! Here is a close up of a section on the website where the headers and text properties already have been giving. Which means I almost didn't need to write any CSS for the headers or the text!</p>
